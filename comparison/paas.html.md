## Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) - Heroku, CloudFoundry, etc

Atlas is similar to a PaaS in terms of simple workflow — one command to develop and one command to deploy. Where Atlas differs is with flexibility, as it allows organizations to use their existing tooling. Atlas encapsulates the existing tooling, such as configuration management, CI, containers, and infrastructure, and coordinates the pieces into one workflow and one dashboard. Conversely, most PaaS options force organizations to modify their application structure to fit the PaaS paradigm. Atlas is collaborative, where PaaS is prescriptive. 

Additionally, Since Atlas is built on HashiCorp's open source tools, and each step is connected by public API, organizations can decide which aspects of Atlas to use. One could leverage the simple development environments and deployment process, while using a custom registry to upload and store artifacts. Or use Atlas' artifact registry with your own custom deployment process. Since the core of Atlas is open source, the interactions are completely up to the end user.
